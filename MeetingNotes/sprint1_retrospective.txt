Overall Notes:


1. [20] Web application must be secure and protect confidentiality of a user’s ImHungry
data
 - Completed mostly
 - only need https front-end
 - password hashing was good
 - host on heroku front-end to enable https://


2. [15] Maintain information beyond just a single session
 - Product broke down during presentation
 	- Tests successful
 - List Management broke down (saving didn't show)


3. [20] Allow for pagination of results returned by the search.
 - Front- End
	 - 5 items per list (simple front-end change) [1 pagination list]
	 - next and previous for the pagination buttons
	 - atleast 5 pages in an example (for a demo) 


4. [30] View results of prior searches by clicking on a quick access list that shows prior
search terms.
	- Did not implement

5. [20] User interfaces must look modern and be attractive
	- Login and registration had to match color scheme

_____________________________
Team recap/feedback:
	Cons:
		- synchronization between back-end and front-end
		- more discussion in sprint meeting about progress on either team
		- space out the scrums
		- write tests first
		- Outline documentation earlier
		- don't commit to master
	Pros:
		- Clean distribution of work
		- Good use of the slack channel
		- Meeting times were easy to communicate
		- Good division of labor
		- good information documentation
_____________
Plan for next time:
	- at scrum meetings divide section into front-end/back-end discussion
	- Meet earlier
	- write tests for new sections
	- delegate back-end front-end tasks at the next sprint
