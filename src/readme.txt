npx create-react-app myapp
cd myapp
yarn add react-router-dom --save

replace src

npm start



notes:

access pages by doing /Recipe or /Restaurant as links for those have not been made

will prob have to do everything as a table as modifying css might be to long

do we have to implement list functionalities...or can that be handled in the backend when generating the json
